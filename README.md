Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed. 

Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology. 

In this project, we makea microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and exchange messages and transactions using blockchain.
